Hello! My name is Arion and I'm a student studying molecular and cellular biology @ UIUC.
The realm of biology I (currently) enjoy most is some mixture of immunology, bioinformatics, and systems biology.
Currently my primary interests lie in the application of machine learning and computational analysis to biological concepts.
When I have rare additional time, I enjoy spending time talking about football (American and European) and reading philosophy texts.
I also have a academic interest in philosophy, specifically ethics and metaphysics, so let me know if you want to talk about Kant or Liebnitz


## Current

**Research**

* [Mobility and Fall Prevention Research Laboratory](https://mfp.kch.illinois.edu/) (FA23-Present)
  - Developing a model of fall risk and frailty using an analysis pipeline built in R.
  - Characterizing differences in postural control in community dwelling older adults using clinical measures.
  - Model changes in postural control strategy using MATLAB stochastic control model.



**Club(s)**

* Member of [UIUC BMES](https://www.bmes-uiuc.com/): UIUC Chapter of Biomedical Engineering Society (FA23 - Present)
  - Using [Alphafold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) in order to find a shape of a protein based on a specific amino acid sequence or chain. The deep learning system will allow us to identify and perform predictions of protein structures. We want to identify protein components in order to link amino acids to activity of something in the body of an organism. To be presented at the SP 24 Engineering Open House
